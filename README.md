# Teensy-Iris
Moving iris for animatronic eye based on concept by David Boccabella: http://forums.stanwinstonschool.com/discussion/1470/animatronic-pupil-for-eye

This version uses an Adafruit 1.5" TFT LCD (product #2088) and a PJRC Teensy 3.1 microcontroller. This WILL NOT WORK on normal Arduino or other boards -- the code is much too large.

Should look amazing on an OLED (e.g. www.adafruit.com/product/1431) but I don't have one around at the moment. This code is written for the TFT above and will not work with the OLED unless a few changes are made.
